## Project Overview

Converting 2D DWG linework into accurate 3D T-bar ceiling systems was eating up hundreds of hours annually in supplemental modeling tasks. Our team needed a solution that could automatically generate precise T-bar layouts directly from architectural drawings.

## The Challenge

- Manual modeling of T-bar systems from DWG linework was time-intensive
- Repetitive tasks were consuming 200+ hours annually
- Need for consistent, accurate ceiling grid layouts across projects
- Coordination between architectural drawings and 3D models

## Technical Solution

**Tools Used:** Dynamo for Revit, Custom Python scripting
**Input:** DWG linework and ceiling boundaries
**Output:** Fully modeled T-bar ceiling systems with proper spacing and connections

### Workflow Highlights:
1. **DWG Import & Processing** - Automated import and filtering of relevant linework
2. **Grid Generation** - Intelligent spacing algorithms based on standard T-bar dimensions
3. **Boundary Detection** - Automatic recognition of ceiling perimeters
4. **Family Placement** - Precise placement of T-bar families with proper connections

## Results & Impact

- **200+ hours saved annually** in departmental efficiency gains
- **Consistent modeling standards** across all projects
- **Reduced human error** in ceiling system layouts
- **Faster project delivery** for coordination drawings

## Key Features

- Handles complex ceiling geometries automatically
- Maintains proper T-bar spacing and alignment
- Generates cut lists and material takeoffs
- Seamlessly integrates with existing Revit workflows

*This automation has become a cornerstone of our VDC modeling process, allowing our team to focus on higher-value coordination tasks while maintaining modeling accuracy.*
